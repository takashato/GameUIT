## Introduction
This project was used in UIT for the course Introduction to Game Development. This emulates the game `Captain America and The Avengers`, developed by `Data East`.\
We use the basic technique in the game development to introduce the operation of a simple 2D-platform game.
- Perfect game loop (game speed is independent from FPS, FPS is limited to frame rate).
- Sprite handler.
- Tilemap.
- State machine / State pattern.
- Singleton pattern.
- SweptAABB and Basic AABB collisions check.
- Grid world partition.
